- 👋 Hi, I’m @eashwarmp
- 👀 I’m interested in MERN Stack and Java.
- 🌱 I’m practising developing fullstack apps(with mern) now. I would sure love to learn java a bit more though :P
-   I've worked a lot with MongoDB and SQL integrated with Java and Node JS too. I would love to learn cosmosDB next.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JS or NodeJS projects for fun.
